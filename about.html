                <h2>about me</h2>
                <p>Since, my childhood I've been fascinated by computers and technology, I was curious enough to learn
                    the complete powerpoint on my own when I was 10 years old. as a result I spent years of my chldhood
                    learning about them, playing computer games, fixing my computer.</p>
                <p>other than programming I enjoy
                    astrophotography a hobby I picked up casually exploring my phone
                    camera's capabilites, I've captured different shots of moons, stars & nebulas.</p>
                <p>here are some of my captures:</p>

                <p>During my college, I started writing my own blog, "The Zero Days of Life" where I write about my
                    daily life, my failures, challenges etc. It has been a year and it always outgrows my fascination. I
                    talk about a lot of things from my life, and my experiences.

                <h2>my inspirations</h2>

                <p>My work reflects my inspirations, I have been very much inspired by Iron Man (for putting his passion
                    for technology above everything else), Rocky Balboa (for never giving up), Linus Torvalds (for his
                    beautiful contribution to
                    open source), Pink Floyd (for every one of their life altering hits), Jason Broady (for his
                    everything can be done attitude).</p>
